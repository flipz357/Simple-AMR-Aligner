# Simple and unsupervised AMR-to-text alignment based on Wasserstein Weisfeiler Leman

The repository contains python code for Wasserstein based AMR to text alignment. This is the key assumption:

**Every token has some correspondence in the AMR, and every AMR part has some correspondence in the sentence**

Note that this differs from other AMR alignment conceptualizations, e.g., where nodes/tokens can remain unaligned.


## Requirements

Install the following python packages (with pip or conda):

```
numpy (tested: 1.19.4)
scipy (tested: 1.1.0) 
networkx (tested: 2.5)
gensim (tested: 3.8.3)
penman (tested: 1.1.0)
pyemd (tested: 0.5.1)
spacy (tested: 3.4.1)
```

## Computing AMR-text alignment (AMR Nodes to token(offsets))

Recommended command:

```
cd src
python wasser_align.py -a test.amr \
		       -output_type score_alignment \ 
                       -stability_level 15 -k 10
```

Here's how such a file may look on the inside:

```
# ::id 1
# ::snt A cat runs
(r / run-01
	:arg0 (c / cat))

# ::id 2
...
```

The method 

1. uses spacy to project dependency graphs
2. uses 10 Weisfeiler-Leman iterations to project AMR and Dep graph into a similar space
3. Calculate Wasserstein distance, using calculated transport plan
4. return transport plan as alignment


## Interesting variation: additionally align dependency edges to AMR edges

We can also align full relation triples (e.g., `x arg0 y` VS `x nsubj y`), by raising edge labels to nodes (obtaining unlabeled graph).

This can be achieved by setting an additional parameter:

Recommended command:

```
cd src
python wasser_align.py -a test.amr \
		       -output_type score_alignment \
                       -stability_level 15 -k 10 \
		       --edge_to_node_transform 
```

## Interpreting output

For each sentence-amr pair a json dictionary is returned:


- score: wasserstein similarity between dependency tree and amr
- alignment: Wasserstein transport plan, keys are amr nodes, values are dictionaries where keys are offset_lemmas and values are flow, cost transportation


E.g.:

```
{"score": 0.684, "alignment": {"r": {"0_a": [0.166666, 0.42018861671278135], "6_run": [0.333333, 0.301206603576575]}, "c": {"0_a": [0.166667, 0.41607656600109755], "2_cat": [0.333333, 0.22984406628413767]}}}
```
Which means that

```
AMR node "r"(run) is projected to token "runs" with flow = 0.3333
AMR node "r"(run) is also projected to token "a" with flow = 0.167
AMR node "c"(cat) is projected to token "cat" ith flow 0.3333
AMR node "c"(cat) is also projected to token "a" with flow 0.167
```

the word "a" is distributed over two nodes, since 3 words need to be aligned to 2 AMR nodes in the example.

### Important Options

Some options that can be set according to use-case

- `-w2v_uri <string>`: use different word embeddings (FastText, word2vec, etc.). Current default: `glove-wiki-gigaword-100`.
- `-k <int>`: Use an int to specify the maximum contextualization level. E.g., If k=5, a node will receive info from nbs that are up to 5 hops away.
- `-stability_level <int>`: Consider two graphs with a few random parameters. We calculate the expected node distance matrix by sampling parameters `<int>` times. This increases stability of results but also increases runtime. A good trade-off may be 10 or 20. 
- `-communication_direction <string>`: There are three options. Consider (x, :arg0, y), where :arg0 is directed. Option `fromin` means y receives from x. Option `fromout` means that x receives from y. `both` (default value) means `fromin` *and* `fromout`.
- `--edge_to_node_transform`: This flag transforms the edge-labeled AMR graph into an (equivalent) graph with unlabeled edges. E.g., (1, arg1, 2), (1, arg2, 3) --> (1, 4), (1, 5), (4, 2), (5, 3), where 4 has label arg1 and 5 has label arg2.

Moreover, the current metrics have complementary strengths and weaknesses: Some emphasize speed, while others make the alignment of graph structures explicit, at the price of a costly alignment step.In this work we propose new Weisfeiler-Leman AMR similarity metrics that unify the strengths of previous metrics, while mitigating their weaknesses. Specifically, our new metrics are able to match contextualized substructures and induce n:m alignments between their nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a Benchmark for AMR Metrics based on Overt Objectives (Bamboo), the first benchmark to support empirical assessment of graph-based MR similarity metrics. Bamboo maximizes the interpretability of results by defining multiple overt objectives that range from sentence similarity objectives to stress tests that probe a metricâ€™s robustness against meaning-altering and meaning- preserving graph transformations. We show the benefits of Bamboo by profiling previous metrics and our own metrics. Results indicate that our novel metrics may serve as a strong baseline for future work.}",
